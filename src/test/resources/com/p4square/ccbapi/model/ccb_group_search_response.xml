                <description>What is the truth?&#13;
                    &#13;
                    This has become the defining question of our time. But while everyone has an opinion, truth, it seems, is getting harder and harder to find. Perhaps that's because we are searching for something when we should be looking for someone. &#13;
                    &#13;
                    Truth has a name.&#13;
                    &#13;
                    More ancient than time and more present than this moment, the truth is not a river that changes with the cultural currents, but a rock--immovable, invincible, unshakeable--and the cornerstone of all we are and ever dream to be.&#13;
